OpenAI Integration Features and Capabilities

This document describes the comprehensive OpenAI integration features available in this Node.js application.

Core Features:
1. Chat Interface - Interactive conversations with GPT models
2. Knowledge Base - Upload and query documents using embeddings
3. Image Generation - Create images from text descriptions using DALL-E
4. Audio Processing - Speech-to-text and text-to-speech capabilities
5. Content Moderation - Automatic content filtering and safety checks

Technical Implementation:
- Frontend: React with TypeScript and Vite
- Backend: Node.js with Express server
- File Processing: Support for .txt, .pdf, and .docx documents
- Database: In-memory storage for demonstration purposes
- AI Models: GPT for chat, DALL-E for images, Whisper for audio

Usage Instructions:
1. Enable desired features using the sidebar toggles
2. Upload documents by dragging them to the upload area
3. Ask questions about uploaded content
4. Generate images by requesting "create an image of..."
5. Use voice input when audio features are enabled

The application demonstrates modern AI integration patterns and can serve as a foundation for building more complex AI-powered applications.
