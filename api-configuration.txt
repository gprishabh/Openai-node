API Configuration and Environment Setup

This document covers the configuration requirements for the OpenAI Node.js application.

Environment Variables Required:
- OPENAI_API_KEY: Your OpenAI API key for accessing GPT, DALL-E, and Whisper
- NODE_ENV: Set to 'development' for local development or 'production' for deployment
- PORT: Server port (default: 5000)
- MAX_FILE_SIZE: Maximum upload file size in bytes (default: 10MB)

OpenAI Model Configuration:
- Chat Model: gpt-4 or gpt-3.5-turbo for conversations
- Embedding Model: text-embedding-ada-002 for knowledge base
- Image Model: dall-e-3 for image generation
- Audio Model: whisper-1 for transcription
- TTS Model: tts-1 for text-to-speech

Security Considerations:
- API keys should be stored securely in environment variables
- File uploads are limited to specific MIME types
- Content moderation is enabled by default
- Session data is stored in memory (not persistent across restarts)

Performance Optimization:
- Text chunking for better embedding quality (800 tokens per chunk)
- Similarity threshold for knowledge base queries (default: 0.6)
- Request rate limiting may be needed for production use
- Consider implementing caching for frequently accessed data

Deployment Notes:
- Build the application using 'npm run build'
- Set production environment variables
- Configure proper CORS settings for your domain
- Monitor API usage and costs through OpenAI dashboard
